## About
Made with: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Webpack, The Open Weather API

The goal of this project was to get some practice with Promises and Async/Await. I also learned about the Event Loop which helped to make sense of what exactly is going on in the background when writing asynchronous code (I really enjoyed this video on the topic -> [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ)). I had been looking forward to getting some experience with this stuff as it opens up a world of opportunity as far as working with API's and designing front-ends that adapt and change do incoming data. I also know that working with Promises now is good practice for when I get to JavaScript on the backend with Node and Express.
